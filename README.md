# GoBack_N_StayThere

The project consists of one pair of nodes [Node0, Node1], andone coordinator that is connected to the pair.
The pair of nodes would communicate and exchange messages using the Go Back N
algorithm with noisy channel and sender window of size WS, receiver window of size WR=1, using Byte
Stuffing as a framing algorithm, and Parity Byte as an error detection algorithm.
